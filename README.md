# Dog breed classification CNN
This repository contains an [IPyNotebook](./dog_app.ipynb) I used to make a dog breed classification convolutional neural network.

This was one of my projects at [__Udacity__](https://in.udacity.com/) during my __Neural network Foundation__ course.

Click [here](report.html) to check out the html version if you can't open the IPyNotebook.

__NOTE__: The `images`, some Markup text in the IPyNotebook and `extract_bottleneck_features.py` script was provided by __Udacity__.
